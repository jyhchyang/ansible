# ansible
Setting up ansible configuration management at home.

Ansible is a simple configuration management, deployment, task-execution, and multinode orchestration framework.

It uses SSH for the communication between the involved systems, no server or client daemons are needed, and no additional software beside Python on managed nodes is required.

There are only minimal requirements for the clients. For every system you want to manage, you need to have the client's SSH key in the authorized_keys file of the management system and Python.
